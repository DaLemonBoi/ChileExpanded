# ChileExpanded
A HOI4 mod expanding on chile, mainly focusing on the anarcho-communism aspect.

## Installing manualing 
Normally you can use the Steam Workshop to automatically download the mod but until the mod is in a full version state it will not be uploaded to the Steam Workshop. To install it before then follow the steps below.

#### Windows

1. Clone the github repo.
2. Unzip then copy the folder to your documents\paradox interactive\hearts of iron iv\mod
3. Cut chile.mod out of the repo folder and into the mod folder above.
4. (Optional) Delete README.md and UNLICENSE from the repo folder. Your game should work fine if they are still there but this is not yet tested. If you experience errors please try this step.

The mod should now be available to select from in the Hearts of Iron IV launcher.

#### Linux

1. Run these.
```
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/DaLemonBoi/ChileExpanded
unzip ChileExpanded
cp ChileExpanded/chile.mod `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod` && cp -r ChileExpanded `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod`
rm `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/README.md` && rm `~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/mod/UNLICENSE`
```

The mod should now be available to select from in the Hearts of Iron IV launcher.
