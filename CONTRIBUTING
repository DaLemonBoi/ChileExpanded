To contribute to ChileExpanded first fork the repo and apply your changes. Once you are done developing follow the instructions in AUTHORS and send a pull request to merge to our master branch. Once reviewed by our collaborators your works will be added to our project and copyright waived. All text files should have comments telling you what they do and how to use them at at least a basic level. If you see an uncommented text file please check projects to see if it is in the works then if not, contact me (see README.md)
